BasicToken Smart Contract
This project contains a simple ERC-20-like token smart contract written in Solidity. It allows users to mint, transfer, and check token balances. The contract is deployed on Ethereum test networks like Goerli or Sepolia for testing purposes.

Features
Minting: Ability to create new tokens and assign them to any address.
Transfer: Allows token holders to transfer tokens to other accounts.
Balance Check: Users can check the token balance of any account.
Prerequisites
MetaMask Wallet Extension
Remix IDE (or any other Solidity IDE)
Testnet ETH from Goerli or Sepolia faucet
Getting Started
1. Clone the Project
If the project is on GitHub or any repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd <your-project-directory>
2. Install MetaMask
Install the MetaMask browser extension if you havenâ€™t already.

Open MetaMask and create a new wallet or restore an existing one.
Add the Goerli or Sepolia test network to MetaMask.
3. Get Testnet ETH
To deploy the contract, you'll need test ETH:

Use the Sepolia Faucet or Goerli Faucet to request free test ETH.
4. Open and Compile the Contract
Open Remix IDE.
Create a new file called BasicToken.sol in the File Explorer.
Copy and paste the following code into the file:
solidity
Copy code
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract BasicToken {
    string public name = "BasicToken";
    string public symbol = "BTK";
    uint8 public decimals = 18;
    uint256 public totalSupply;

    mapping(address => uint256) public balanceOf;

    event Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 value);
    event Mint(address indexed to, uint256 value);

    // Function to mint new tokens
    function mint(address to, uint256 amount) public {
        totalSupply += amount;
        balanceOf[to] += amount;
        emit Mint(to, amount);
    }

    // Function to transfer tokens
    function transfer(address to, uint256 amount) public returns (bool) {
        require(balanceOf[msg.sender] >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
        balanceOf[msg.sender] -= amount;
        balanceOf[to] += amount;
        emit Transfer(msg.sender, to, amount);
        return true;
    }

    // Function to check the balance of an address
    function getBalance(address account) public view returns (uint256) {
        return balanceOf[account];
    }
}
In the Solidity Compiler tab (the "S" icon on the left), compile the contract using a Solidity version (0.8.0 or later).
5. Deploy the Contract
Go to the Deploy & Run Transactions tab (the "Ethereum" icon).
Set the environment to Injected Web3. This will allow Remix to connect to MetaMask.
Make sure MetaMask is connected to the Goerli or Sepolia test network.
Select your contract from the list and click Deploy.
Confirm the transaction in MetaMask.
6. Interact with the Contract
Once deployed, you can interact with the smart contract:

Mint Tokens: Use the mint(address to, uint256 amount) function to create new tokens.
Transfer Tokens: Use the transfer(address to, uint256 amount) function to send tokens to another account.
Check Balance: Use the getBalance(address account) function to check the token balance of any account.
Testing the Contract
Mint some tokens for your own wallet address using the mint() function in Remix.
Use the getBalance() function to verify that tokens were added.
Transfer tokens to another wallet and check their balance.
Technologies Used
