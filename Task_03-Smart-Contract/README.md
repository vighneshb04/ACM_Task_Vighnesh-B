# BasicToken Smart Contract

This project contains a simple ERC-20-like token smart contract written in Solidity. It allows users to mint, transfer, and check token balances. The contract is deployed on Ethereum test networks like Goerli or Sepolia for testing purposes.

## Features
- **Minting**: Ability to create new tokens and assign them to any address.
- **Transfer**: Allows token holders to transfer tokens to other accounts.
- **Balance Check**: Users can check the token balance of any account.

## Prerequisites
- MetaMask Wallet Extension
- Remix IDE (or any other Solidity IDE)
- Testnet ETH from Goerli or Sepolia faucet (or Google Cloud for free test ETH)

## Getting ETH from Google Cloud
To get free test ETH for deploying and interacting with smart contracts, you can use Google Cloud to access Ethereum test networks like Goerli and Sepolia. Follow these steps:
1. Sign up for Google Cloud and set up a basic Ethereum node.
2. Use the Google Cloud Ethereum node to interact with Ethereum's testnet, and request test ETH using faucets such as Goerli or Sepolia.

Alternatively, you can directly use the Goerli Faucet or Sepolia Faucet to request free test ETH if you prefer not to use Google Cloud.

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Project
